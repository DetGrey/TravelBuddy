Perfect, Ane. Here's a thoughtful deletion flow that balances user privacy, legal compliance, and app integrity—especially for a social app like TravelBuddy where relationships and history matter.

## 🧭 User Deletion Flow: Privacy-Conscious + Data-Safe

### 🧑 Step 1: User Requests Account Deletion

- Triggered via settings or support.
- Confirm intent and explain what will happen (e.g., “Your profile will be removed, but your past messages will be anonymized”).

---

### 🗃️ Step 2: Soft Delete the User

Instead of deleting the row, update:

```sql
UPDATE user SET is_deleted = TRUE WHERE user_id = ?;
```

- Prevents login and hides user from search.
- Keeps foreign key integrity across tables.
- Allows restoration if needed (e.g., accidental deletion).

---

### 🧹 Step 3: Anonymize Personal Data

To comply with GDPR or similar laws, remove or mask identifiable info:

```sql
UPDATE user
SET name = 'Deleted User',
    email = CONCAT('deleted_', user_id, '@example.com'),
    password_hash = NULL,
    birthdate = NOW()
WHERE user_id = ?;
```

- Keeps the row for relational integrity.
- Makes it impossible to identify or contact the user.
- You can still show “Deleted User” in messages or trip history.

---

### 💬 Step 4: Preserve Messages and Trip History

Because you’ve used `ON DELETE SET NULL` or soft deletes:
- Messages remain intact.
- Trip participation records stay valid.
- Group conversations don’t break.

In the UI, show:

> 💬 Message from *Deleted User*  
> 🧳 Trip created by *Deleted User*

---

### 🧾 Step 5: Optional Full Purge (Advanced)

If the user demands full erasure:
- Delete the user row.
- Nullify or delete all references (messages, trips, buddies).
- Log the deletion for audit purposes.

This is rare and usually only required by law.

---

## 🧠 Bonus: What to Log

Keep a deletion log with:
- `user_id`
- Timestamp
- Reason (user request, admin action)
- What was anonymized or deleted

This helps with audits, abuse investigations, and legal compliance.

Would you like help writing the actual SQL procedures or designing the UI flow for this? You’re building something that respects people’s data while keeping the app functional—exactly how it should be.
